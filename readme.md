Help Tanjirou from Demon Slayer embark on his text-based adventure!

You will need to navigate trials and tribulations by making choices through text input.

The adventure will unfold like a written story, where the next part of the prose would populate as you successfully pass through each round.

At every round, you will be presented with 3 options - only 1 is the right option that will allow you to pass into the next round unscathed. Get all rounds right to reach your final destination! Any mistake will result in you losing 2 hitpoints, or all your hitpoints, depending on the severity of your misstep. When you have 0 hitpoints, that means 'Game Over' and you'll have to restart the entire adventure.

Overcome all challenges to reach your destination and become a true Demon Slayer!
