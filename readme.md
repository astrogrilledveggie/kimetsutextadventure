Help Tanjirou from Demon Slayer embark on his text-based adventure!

You will need to navigate trials and tribulations by making choices through text input.

The adventure will unfold like a written story, where the next part of the prose would populate as you successfully pass through each round.

At every round, you will be presented with 3 options - only 1 is the right option that will allow you to pass into the next round unscathed. Get all rounds right to reach your final destination! Any mistake will result in you losing 2 hitpoints, or all your hitpoints, depending on the severity of your misstep. When you have 0 hitpoints, that means 'Game Over' and you'll have to restart the entire adventure.

Overcome all challenges to reach your destination and become a true Demon Slayer!

Stretch Goals:

- background IMG/BGM changes with the choices made
- store game progress
- ~[DONE] jump view to new Chapter~
- load story with scroll
- ~[BUGGED] build modals for nicer pop-ups~
- append the options taken as part of the story
- alert when hp is low
- ~[DONE] prompts for why the decision led to gameOver~
- ~[DONE] prevent inputs to earlier chapters once the chapter has been cleared~

TA Comments:

- ~[BUGGED] set HP counter in a separate div on the page~
- ~[DONE] set gameUI in a fixed width (so that it doesn't expand over that limit)~
- ~[BUGGED] modals: use bootstrap modals (easier)~
- soundover for good/bad/terrible options
- music can change according to the hps

Problems faced:

- Modals did not work
- lifebar visibility affected scrollintoview
- for loop for lifebar did not work beyond first chapter
